            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O a diſcourſe upon theſe words, I cannot think of any fitter introduction, then that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our Saviour ſomeime began a Sermon of his, <hi>This day is this Scripture fulfilled.</hi> And I would to God there were not great occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to feare that a great part of it may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in this place.</p>
            <p>Two things are contained in it: Firſt, the reall wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the generality of the men of the latter times, in the foure firſt verſes. For by men ſhall be lovers of themſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, &amp;c. I conceive is meant, men generally ſhall be ſo, otherwiſe this were nothing peculiar to the laſt, but common to all times, for in all times ſome, nay many have been lovers of themſelves, covetous, boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, proud, &amp;c. Secondly, we have here the formall and hypocriticall godlineſſe of the ſame times, in the laſt verſe, having a forme of godlineſſe, but denying the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:155203:3"/> which latter ordinarily and naturally accompanies the former. For as the ſhadowes are longeſt when the Sunne is loweſt, and as vines and other fruit trees beare the leſſe fruit, when they are ſuffered to luxuriate and ſpend their ſap upon ſuperfluous ſuckers, and abundance of leaves: So commonly we may obſerve both in Civill converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where there is great ſtore of formality, there is little ſincerity: and in Religion, where there is a decay of true and cordiall piety, there men entertaine and pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and vainly hope to pleaſe God with externall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, and performances, and great ſtore of that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe for which Chriſt ſhall judge the world.</p>
            <p>It were no difficult matter to ſhew that the truth of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> prediction is by experience juſtified in both parts of it, but my purpoſe is to reſtraine my ſelfe to the latter, and to endeavour to cleare unto you, that that in our times is generally accompliſhed: That almoſt in all places the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Godlineſſe is decayed and vaniſhed, the forme and profeſſion of it onely remaining: That the ſpirit, and ſoule, and life of Religion, is for the moſt part gone, onely the outward body or carcaſe, or rather the picture or ſhadow of it, being left behind: This is the Doctrine which at this time I ſhall deliver to you, and the uſe, which I deſire moſt heartily you ſhould make of it, is this. To take care that you confute, ſo farre as it concernes your particulars, what I feare I ſhall prove too true in the generall.</p>
            <p>To come then to our buſineſſe without further comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let us examine our wayes, and conſider impartially what the Religion of moſt men is.</p>
            <p>We are baptized in our infancy, that is, as I conceive, dedicated and devoted to Gods ſervice, by our Parents and the Church, as young <hi>Samuel</hi> was by his mother <hi>Anna,</hi> and there we take a ſolemne vow, <hi>To forſake the Devill and all his workes, the vaine pompe and glory of the world, with all the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:155203:3"/> covetous deſires of it, to forſake alſo all the carnall deſires of the fleſh, and not to follow nor be led by them.</hi> This vow we take when we be children and underſtand it not: and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are there who know, and conſider, and regard what they have vowed, when they are become men, almoſt as little as they did being children? conſider the lives, and publique Actions of moſt men of all conditions in Court, City, and Country, and then deny it if you can, that thoſe three things which we have renounced in our baptiſme, the profits, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and pleaſures of the world, are not the very gods which divide the world amongſt them, are not ſerved more devoutly, confided in more heartily, loved more affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, then the <hi>Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in whoſe name we are baptized: deny if you can the daily and conſtant imployment of all men, to be either a violent proſecution of the vaine pompe and glory of the world, or of the power, riches, and contemptible profits of it, or of the moment any or unſatisfying pleaſures of the fleſh, or elſe of the more diabolicall humours of pride, malice, revenge, and ſuch like: and yet with this empty forme we pleaſe and ſatisfie our ſelves, as well as if we were lively borne againe by the Spirit of God, not knowing, or not regarding what Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath taught us, That the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> which muſt ſave us, is, <hi>Not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3 21</note> 
               <hi>but the anſwer of a good conſcience unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When wee are come to yeeres capable of inſtruction, many, which is lamentable to conſider, are ſo little regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by themſelves or others, that they continue little better then Pagans in a Common-wealth of Chriſtians, and know little more of God or of Chriſt, then if they had beene bred in the Indies. A lamentable caſe, and which will one day lye heavie upon their account, which might have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it and did not. But many I confeſſe are taught to act over this play of Religion, and learned to ſay, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which art in Heaven;</hi> and, <hi>I beleeve in God the Father Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty:</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:155203:4"/> but where are the men that live ſo, as if they beleeve in earneſt, that God is their Almighty Father? where are they that feare him, and truſt him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him onely, for their whole happineſſe, and love him, and obey him, as in reaſon we ought to doe to an Almighty Father? who if he be our Father, and we be indeed his children, will do for us all the good he can; and if he be Almighty, can doe for us all the good he will; and yet how few are there, who love him with halfe that affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as Children uſually do their naturall Parents, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve him with halfe that ſimplicity, or ſerve him with halfe that diligence? And then for the Lords prayer, the plaine truth is, we lie unto God for the moſt part cleane through it, and for want of deſiring indeed what in word we pray for, tell him to his face as many falſe tales as we make Petitions. For who ſhewes by his endeavours, that he deſires heartily that <hi>Gods Name ſhould be hallowed,</hi> that is, holily, and religiouſly worſhipped and adored by all men? That <hi>his Kingdome ſhould be advanced and inlarged? That his bleſſed will ſhould be univerſally obeyed?</hi> Who ſhewes by his forſaking ſinne, that he deſires ſo much as he ſhould do the forgiveneſſe of it? Nay, who doth not revenge upon all occaſions, the affronts, contempts, and injuries put upon him, and ſo upon the matter curſe himſelfe, as oft as he ſayes, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe againſt us?</hi> How few depend upon God onely for their <hi>dayly Bread, viz.</hi> the good things of this life, as upon the onely giver of them, ſo as neither to get nor keepe any of them, by any meanes which they know or feare to be offenſive unto God? How few deſire in earneſt to <hi>avoyd temptation?</hi> Nay, who almoſt is there, that takes not the Devils office out of his hand, and is not himſelfe a tempter both to himſelfe and others? Laſtly, who almoſt is there that deſires heartily and above all things, ſo much as the thing deſerves, to be delivered from the <hi>greateſt evill,</hi> ſinne,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155203:4"/> I meane, and the anger of God? Now beloved this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, he that imployes not requiſite induſtry, to obtaine what he pretends to deſire, does not deſire indeed, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretends to do ſo: He that deſires not what he prayes for, prayes with tongue onely, and not with his heart; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed does not pray to God, but play and dally with him. And yet this is all which men generally doe, and therefore herein alſo accompliſh this prophecie, <hi>having a forme of godlineſſe, but denying the power thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this were ill enough, were it in private, but we abuſe God Almighty alſo with our publike and ſolemne formalities, we make the Church a Stage whereon to act our parts and play our pageants, there we make a profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every day of <hi>confeſſing our ſinnes with humble, lowly, and obedient hearts,</hi> and yet when we have talked after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, 20. 30. 40. yeeres together, our hearts for the moſt part continue as proud, as impenitent, as diſobedient, as they were in the beginning. We make great Proteſtations <hi>when we aſsemble and meet together to render thanks to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, for the benefit received at his hands;</hi> and if this were to be performed with words, with <hi>Hoſanna's</hi> &amp; <hi>Hallelujah's,</hi> and <hi>gloria patri's,</hi> and Pſalmes and Hymnes, and ſuch like outward matters, peradventure we ſhould doe it very ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently: but in the meane time with our lives and actions, we provoke the Almighty, and that to his face, with all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of grievous and bitter provocations; we doe dayly and hourely ſuch things as we know, and he hath aſſured us to bee odious unto him, and contrary to his nature, as any thing in the world is to the nature of any man in the world; and all this upon poore, trifling, triviall, no temptations. If a man whom you had dealt well with, ſhould deale ſo with you, one whom ye had redeemed from the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ſlavery, and inſtated in ſome indifferent good inheritance, ſhould make you fine ſpeeches, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine you with Panegyricks, and have your praiſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155203:5"/> in his mouth, but all this while doe nothing that pleaſes you, but upon all occaſions, put all affronts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities upon you, would you ſay this were a thankfull man? Nay would you not make heaven and earth to ring of his unthankfulneſſe, and deteſt him almoſt as much for his faire ſpeeches, as his foule actions? Beloved, ſuch is our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe to our God and Creatour, to our Lord and Saviour;<note place="margin">Mat. 21 9. M rk 15.13.14.</note> our tongues ingeminate, and cry aloud, <hi>Hoſanna, Hoſanna,</hi> but the lowder voice of our lives and actions is <hi>crucifie him, crucifie him:</hi> We Court God Almighty, and complement with him, and profeſſe to eſteeme his ſervice <hi>perfect freedome,</hi> but if any thing be to be done, much more if any thing be to be ſuffered for him, here we leave him, we bow the knee before him, and put a reed in his hand, and a Crowne upon his head, and cry, <hi>Haile King of the Iewes:</hi> But then with our Cuſtomary ſinnes, we give him gall to eat, and vinegar to drinke, we thruſt a ſpeare in his ſide, naile him to the Croſſe, and Crucifie to our ſelves the Lord of Glory. This is not the Office of a friend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile a dead friend with vaine lamentation. <hi>Sed quae volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit meminiſse, quae mandaverit exequi,</hi> to remember what he deſires, and execute what he commands; ſo ſaid a dying Roman to his friend, and ſo ſay I to you, To bee thankfull to God is not to ſay, God be praiſed, or, God be thanked, but to remember what hee deſires, and execute what hee commands, to bee thankfull to God is certainly to love him, and to love him is to keepe his Commandements, ſo ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. <hi>If ye love me keepe my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> If we doe ſo, we may juſtly pretend to thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which beleeve me is not a word, nor to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with words: But if wee doe not ſo, as generally we doe not, our talke of thankfulneſſe is nothing elſe but meere talke, and we accompliſh Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> prophecy herein alſo: Having a forme of thankfulneſſe, but not the reality, not the power of it.</p>

            <p>If I ſhould reckon up unto you, how many direct lies eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wicked man tells God Almighty as often as he ſayes A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>to this forme of godlineſse,</hi> which our Church hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. If I ſhould preſent unto you all our acting of piety, and playing of humiliation, and perſonating of devotion in the Pſalmes, the Letanies, the Collects, and generally in the whole ſervice, I ſhould be infinite: And therefore I have thought good to draw a vaile over a great part of our hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, and to reſtraine the remainder of our diſcourſe to the contrariety between our profeſſion and performance, only in two things; I meane <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt for Faith, We profeſſe, and indeed generally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not ſafe to do otherwiſe, that we believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be true, and that it containes the plaine and onely way to infinite and eternall happineſſe: But if we did gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally beleeve what we doe profeſſe, if this were the language of our hearts as well as our tongues, how comes it to paſſe that the ſtudy of it is ſo generally neglected?</p>
            <p>Let a book that treats of the Philoſophers ſtone, promiſe never ſo many mountains of gold, and even the reſtoring of the golden age againe, yet were it no marvaile if few ſhould ſtudy it, and the reaſon is, becauſe few would beleeve it. But if there were a book extant, and ordinary to be had, as the Bible is, which men did generally beleeve to contain a plain, and eaſie way for all men to become rich, &amp; to live in health and pleaſure, and this worlds happineſſe, can any man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that this book would be unſtudied by any man? And why then ſhould I not beleeve, that if the Scripture were firmly and heartily believed, the certaine and onely way to happineſſe which is perfect and eternall, it would be ſtudied by all men, with all diligence? Seeing therefore moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are ſo cold and negligent in the ſtudy of it, prefer all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buſineſſe, all other pleaſures before it, is there not great reaſon to feare, that many who pretend to beleeve it firmely, beleeve it not at all, or very weakly and faintly? If the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:155203:6"/> of an Army, or an Embaſſadour to ſome Prince or State were aſſured by the King his Maſter, that the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing any poynt of his Commiſſion ſhould coſt him his life, and the exact performance of it be recompenced with as high a reward as were in the Kings power to beſtow upon him: can it be imagined that any man who believes this, and is in his right mind, can be ſo ſupinely and ſtupidly negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of this charge, which ſo much imports him, as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee through want of care any one neceſſarie article or part of his commiſſion: eſpecially if it be delivered to him in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and at his pleaſure to peruſe it every day? Certainly this abſurd negligence is a thing without example, and ſuch as peradventure will never happen to any ſober man to the worlds end: and by the ſame reaſon, if we were firmely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that this book doth indeed contain that charge and commiſſion, which infinitely more concerns us, it were not in reaſon poſſible, but that to ſuch a perſwaſion, our care &amp; diligence about it, ſhould be in ſome meaſure anſwerable: ſeeing therefore moſt of us are ſo ſtrangely careleſſe, ſo groſſely negligent of it, is there not great reaſon to feare, that though we have <hi>profeſſors</hi> and <hi>protestors</hi> in abundance, yet the faithfull, the truely and ſincerely faithfull are in a manner failed from the children of men. What but this can be the cauſe that men are ſo commonly ignorant of ſo many articles, and particular mandates of it, which yet are as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in it as if they were written with the beams of the Sun?

And then on the other ſide they that maintain the Kings righteous cauſe with the hazard of their lives and fortunes; but by their oathes and curſes, by their drunkenneſſe, and debauchery, by their irreligion and prophanneſſe, fight more powerfully againſt their partie, then by all other meanes they doe or can fight for it, are not I feare very well acquainted with any part of the Bible; but that ſtrict caution which properly concerns themſelves in the booke of <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.9. I much doubt they have ſcarce ever heard of it, <hi>When thou goeſt to Wars with thine Enemies, then take heed there be no wicked thing in thee,</hi> not only no wickedneſſe in the cauſe thou maintaineſt, nor no wickedneſſe in the means by which thou maintaineſt it, but no perſonall impieties in the perſons that maintaine it. Beloved for the former two, we have reaſon to be full of comfort and confidence; For what is our cauſe? What is that which you fight, and we pray for? but to deliver the King and all his good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects out of the power of their Enemies, who will have no peace but with their ſlaves and vaſſalls? and for the meanes by which it is maintained, it is not by lying, it is not by calumnies, it is not by running firſt our ſelves, and then forceing the people to univerſall perjury; but by a juſt war, becauſe neceſſary, and by as faire and mercifull a Warre as if they were not Rebells and Traitors you fight againſt,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:155203:8"/> but Competitors in a doubtfull Title. But now for the third part of the caution, that, to deale ingenuouſly with you, and to deliver my owne ſoule, If I cannot other mens, that I cannot think of with halfe ſo much comfort as the former; but ſeeing ſo many <hi>Ionaſses</hi> imbarqued in the ſame ſhip, the ſame cauſe with us, and ſo many <hi>Achan's</hi> entering into Battel with us againſt the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> ſeeing Publicans and ſinners on the one ſide, againſt Scribes and Phariſees on the other; on the one ſide Hypocriſy, on the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanneſſe, no honeſty nor juſtice on the one ſide, and very little piety on the other; On the one ſide horrible oathes, curſes, and blaſphemies; On the other peſtilent lyes, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, and perjury: When I ſee amongſt them the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of reformation, if not the deſire, purſued by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, Mahumetan, devilliſh meanes; and amongſt us little or no zeale for reformation of what is indeed amiſſe, little or no care to remove the cauſe of Gods anger towards us, by juſt, lawfull, and Chriſtian meanes; I profeſſe plainly I cannot without trembling conſider what is likely to be the event of theſe diſtractions; I cannot but feare that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our cauſe may ſinke under the burthen of our ſinns: And that God in his juſtice, becauſe we will not ſuffer his Judgements to acheive their prime ſcope and intention, which is our amendment and reformation, may either deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us up to the blind zeale and fury of our Enemies; or elſe, which I rather feare, make us inſtruments of his juſtice each againſt other, and of our owne juſt and deſerved confuſion. This I profeſſe plainly is my feare, and I would to God it were likewiſe the feare of every Souldier in His Majeſties Army; but that which increaſeth my feare is, that I ſee very many of them have very little or none at all: I meane not that they are feareleſſe towards their Enemies, (that's our joy and Triumph) but that they ſhew their courage even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and feare not him, whom it is madneſſe not to feare. Now from whence can their not fearing him proceed;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:155203:9"/> but from their not knowing him, their not knowing his will and their owne duty? not knowing how highly it concerns Souldiers, above other profeſſions to be religious, and then if ever when they are engaged in dangerous adventures, and every moment have their lives in their hands, <hi>When they goe to Warre with their Enemies, then to take heed there be no wicked thing in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee, beloved, how many inſtances and examples I have given you of our groſſe ignorance of what is neceſſary and eaſie for us to know, and to theſe it were no difficult matter to adde more. Now from whence can this ignorance proceed, but from ſupine negligence? and from whence this negligence, but from our not believing what we pretend to believe? For did we believe firmly and heartily, that this Booke were given us by God for the rule of our Actions, and that obedience to it were the certaine and only way to eternall happineſſe, it were impoſſible we ſhould be ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to our ſelves, ſuch Traytors to our owne ſoules, as not to ſearch it at leaſt with ſo much diligence, that no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary point of our duty plainly taught in it could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly eſcape us. But it is certain, and apparent to all the world, that the greateſt part of Chriſtians, through groſſe and wilfull negligence remaine utterly ignorant of many neceſſary points of their duty to God, and man: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is much to be feared, that this booke, and the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Chriſt contained in it, among an infinite of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, labours with great penury of true beleivers.</p>
            <p>It were an eaſie matter (if the time would permit) to preſent unto you many other demonſtrations of the ſame concluſion; but to this drawn from our willing ignorance of that which is eaſie and neceſſary for us to know, I will content my ſelf to adde only one more taken from our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and preſumptuous neglect to doe thoſe things which we know and acknowledge to be neceſſary.</p>
            <p>If a man ſhould ſay unto me that it concerns him as much
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:155203:9"/> as his life is worth, to goe preſently to ſuch a place, and that he knowes but one way to it, and I ſhould ſee him ſtand ſtill or goe ſome other way, had I any reaſon to believe that this man believes himſelfe? <hi>Quid verba audiam, cum facta videam?</hi> ſaith he in the Comedy. <hi>Poteſtatio contra factum non valet,</hi> ſaith the Law: and why ſhould I believe, that, that man believes obedience to Chriſt the onely way to preſent and eternall happineſſe, when I ſee wittingly, and willingly and conſtantly, and cuſtomarily to diſobey him? The time was that we all knew that the King could reward thoſe that did him ſervice, and puniſh thoſe that did diſ-ſervice, and then all men were ready to obey his commands, and he was a rare man that durſt doe any thing to his face that offended him. Beloved, if we did but believe in God, ſo much as moſt ſubjects doe in their King, did we as verily believe, that God could and would make us perfectly happy if wee ſerve him, though all the world conſpire to make us miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and that he could and would make us miſerable if wee ſerve him not, though al the world ſhould conſpire to make us happy, how were it poſſible that to ſuch a faith our lives ſhould not be comformable? Who was there ever ſo madly in love with a preſent penny, as to run the leaſt hazard of the loſſe of 10000 li. a yeare to gaine it, or not readily to part with it upon any probable hope or light perſwaſion, much more a firme beliefe that by doing ſo he ſhould gaine 100000 li. Now beloved, the happineſſe which the ſervants of Chriſt are promiſed in the Scripture, wee all pretend to believe, that it exceedes the conjunction of all the good things of the world, and much more ſuch a portion as wee may poſſibly enjoy, infinitely more then 10000 li. a yeare, or 100000 li. doth a penny, for 100000 li. is but a penny ſo many times over, and 10000 li. a yeare is worth but a certaine number of pence; but betweene Heaven and Earth, betweene finite and infinite, betweene Eternity and a moment, there is utterly no proportion, and therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:155203:10"/> we are ſo apt upon trifling occaſions, to hazard this Heaven for this Earth, this infinite for this finite, this all for this nothing; is it not much to be feared, that though many of us pretend too much faith, we have indeed very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or none at al? The ſum of all which hath bin ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this point is this. Were we firmely perſwaded that obedience to the Goſpell of Chriſt, is the true and onely way to preſent and eternall happineſſe (without which faith no man living can be Juſtified) then the innate deſire of our owne happineſſe could not but make us ſtudious inquirers of the will of Chriſt, and conſcionable performers of it: but there are (as experience ſhewes) very few, who make it their care and buſineſſe to know the will of Chriſt, and of thoſe few againe, very many, who make no conſcience at all of doing what they know; therfore though they profeſſe &amp; proteſt they have faith, yea their proteſtations are not to be regarded againſt their actions, but we may ſafely and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably conclude what was to be concluded, That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt amongſt an infinite of profeſſors labours with great ſcarcitie of true, and ſerious, and hearty belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and that herein alſo we accompliſh St. <hi>Pauls</hi> predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>having a forme of godlineſſe, but denying the power &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps the truth and reality of our repentance may make ſome kind of ſatisfaction to God Almighty for our hypocriticall dallying with him in all the reſt; truly I ſhould be heartily glad it were ſo: but I am ſo farre from being of this faith, that herein I feare we are moſt of all hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall, and that the generality of profeſſors is ſo farre from a reall practice of true repentance, that ſcarce one it an hundred underſtands truely what it is.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:155203:10"/> For how many are there, that doe rather complaine and murmure that they are ſinners, then acknowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it? and make it upon the matter rather their unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and misfortune, then their true fault, that they are ſo? ſuch are all they who impute all their commiſſions of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill to the unavoydable want of <hi>restraining grace,</hi> and all their omi on of good to the like want of <hi>effectuall exciting grace.</hi> All ſuch as pretend that the Commandements of God are impoſſible to be kept any better then they are kept, and thus the world, the fleſh, and the divell are even omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent enemies, and that God neither doth nor will give ſufficient ſtrength to reſiſt and overcome them. All ſuch as lay al their faults upon <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; ſay with thoſe rebellious Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelities (whom God aſſures that they neither had nor ſhould have juſt reaſon to ſay ſo) <hi>That their Fathers had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſowre grapes, and their teeth were ſet on edge.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.10.</note> but the Goſpel ſayes, &amp; accordingly I have ſaid unto you, that there is mercy alwayes in ſtore, for thoſe <hi>who know the day of their viſitation,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their ſins in time of mercy, and that God will pardon their imperfections in the progreſſe of holineſſe, who miſcall not preſumptuous and deliberate ſins by the name of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; but ſeriouſly and truly endeavour to be perfect; onely I forewarne you that you muſt never looke to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the wedding feaſt of the Kings Son, either in the impure rags of any cuſtomary ſinne, or without the <hi>wedding garment</hi> of Chriſtian holineſſe; onely I forewarne you that whoſoever lookes to be made partaker of the joyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, muſt make it the chiefe, if not the onely buſineſſe of his life, to know the will of God and to doe it; that <hi>great violence</hi> is required by our Saviour for the taking of this Kingdome, that the race we are to run is a long race, the building we are to erect is a great building, and will hardly, very hardly be finiſhed in a day, that the worke we have to doe of mortifying all vices; and acquiring all Chriſtian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, is a long worke; we may eaſily deferre it too long, we cannot poſſibly begin it too ſoone. Onely I would perſwade you, and I hope I have done, that that repentance which is not effectuall to true and timely converſion, will never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable unto eternall ſalvation. And if I have proved unto you that this is indeed the nature of true repentance, then certainly I have proved withall, that that repentance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the generality of Chriſtians content themſelves, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their great profeſſions what they are, and their glorious proteſtations of what they intend to be, is not the <hi>power</hi> but the <hi>forme;</hi> not the truth but the ſhadow of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and that herein alſo we accompliſh Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> prediction, having a <hi>forme of godlineſſe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now what remaines but that (as I ſaid in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,) I ſhould humbly intreat and earneſtly exhort every
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:155203:15"/> man that hath heard me this day, to confute in his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar what I have proved true in the generall. To take care that the ſinne of formality, though it be the ſinne of our times, may yet not be the ſin of our perſons, that we ſatisfie not our ſelves with the ſhadowes of Religion, without the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it, nor with the <hi>forme of godlineſſe</hi> without the <hi>power</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe I ſhall beſeech you to conſider, that though ſacrificing, burning incenſe, celebrating of ſet feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls, praying, faſting, and ſuch like, were under the Law, the ſervice of God commanded by himſelfe, yet whenſoever they proceeded not from, nor were joyned with the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an honeſt heart, he profeſſeth frequently almoſt in all the Prophets, not onely his ſcorne and contempt of them all, as fond, empty, and ridiculous; but alſo his hating, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and deteſting of them as abominable and impious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Sacrifice of the wicked is abomination to God,</hi> Prov. 15, 8. <hi>What have I to doe with the multitude of your Sacrifices? ſaith the Lord,</hi> Eſay the firſt, <hi>I am full of the burnt offerings of Rams, and of the fat of fed beasts, when ye come to appeare before me, who requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this at your hands? Bring no more vaine oblations: Incenſe is an abomination to me, I cannot ſuffer your new moones, nor ſabbaths, nor ſolemne dayes, it is iniquity, even your ſolemne aſſemblies: My ſoule hateth your new moones, and your appoynted feasts, they are a burthen to me, I am weary to beare them; and when you ſhall ſtretch out your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you, and though you make many prayers I will not heare, for your hands are full of blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And againe, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 66, 3. <hi>He that kills an Oxe is a if he ſlew a man, he that ſacrificeth a Lambe as if he cut off a Dogs necke, he that offereth an oblation as if he offered Swines fleſh, he that burned incenſe, as if he bleſsed an Idoll;</hi> and what's the reaſon of this ſtrange averſion of God from his owne Ordinances? it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in the next words, <hi>they have choſen their owne wayes, and their ſoule delighteth in their abominations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Terrible are the words which he ſpe keth to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:155203:16"/> in the prophecie of <hi>Amos,</hi> chap. 5. v. 21, 22, 23. <hi>I hate, I deſpiſe your feaſt dayes, and I will not ſmell in your ſolemne aſſemblies, though you offer me burnt offerings and meat offerings, I will not accept them, nor will I regard your peace offerings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now beloved, if this hypocriſie, this reſting in outward performances, were ſo odious to God under the law, a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion full of ſhadowes, and ceremonies, certainely it will be much more odious to do ſo under the Goſpell, a religion of much more ſimplicity, and exacting ſo much the greater ſincerity of the heart, even becauſe it disburdens the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man of the performance of Legall rites and obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And therefore if we now under the Goſpell, ſhall thinke to delude God Almighty, as <hi>Michall</hi> did <hi>Saul,</hi> with an Idoll handſomely dreſt in ſtead of the true <hi>David.</hi> If we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and pleaſe our ſelves, with being of ſuch or ſuch a Sect or profeſſion, with going to Church, ſaying, or hearing of Prayers, receiving of Sacraments, hearing, repeating, or preaching of Sermons, with zeale for Ceremonies, or zeale againſt them, or indeed with any thing beſides conſtant pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towards God, Loyalty and obedience towards our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, juſtice and charity towards all our Neighbours, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, chaſtity, and ſobriety towards our ſelves, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we ſhall one day find, that we have not mocked God, but our ſelves, and that our portion among hypocrites ſhall be greater, then theirs.</p>
            <p>In the next place let me intreat you to conſider the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full judgement which God hath particularly threatned to this very ſinne of <hi>drawing nigh unto him with our lips, when our hearts are farre from him:</hi> It is the great judgement of being given over to <hi>the ſpirit of ſlumber and ſecuritie,</hi> the uſuall fore-runner of ſpeedy deſolation and deſtruction, as we may ſee in the 29 <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Eſaiah,</hi> from the 9 to the 14 <hi>verſe, Stay your ſelves and wonder, cry ye out, and cry, they are drunken but not with wine, they stagger but not with ſtrong drinke: for the Lord hath powered out upon you the ſpirit of deepe ſleepe, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:155203:16"/> hath cloſed your eyes. The Prophets and your Rulers, the ſeers hath he covered,</hi> and after, at the 14 <hi>verſe, The wiſedome of their wiſe men ſhall periſh, and the underſtanding of their prudent men ſhall be hidde.</hi> Certainely this judgement if ever it were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any people, we have cauſe to feare it is now upon us. For if the ſpirit of <hi>deepe ſleepe</hi> were not upon us, how could we ſleepe ſo ſecurely, even upon the brinke of the pit of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? how could wee proceed on ſo confidently in our mirth and jollity, nay in our crying ſins and horrible impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, now when the hand of God is upon us, and wrath is gone out, and even ready to conſume us? And if the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our wiſe men were not periſhed, how were it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they ſhould ſo obſtinately refuſe the ſecurity offered of our lawes, liberties, and religion by the Kings Oath, by his execrations on himſelfe, and his poſterity, in caſe hee ſhould violate it, by the oathes of all his Miniſters, not to conſent to, or be inſtruments in ſuch a violation, by the ſo much deſired <hi>Trienniall Parliament,</hi> from which no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor can poſſibly be ſecure; and inſtead of all this ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſeeke for it by a civill warre, the continuance whereof muſt bring us to deſtruction and deſolation, or elſe he hath deceived us by whom we are taught,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.25.</note> 
               <hi>That a Kingdome divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt it ſelfe cannot ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what was the ſinne which provoked this feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full judgement? What but that which I have laboured to convince you of, and to diſſwade you from, even the ſin of hypocriſie? as we may ſee at the 12 verſe: <hi>Wherefore ſaith the Lord, foraſmuch as this people draw neare me with their mouth, and with their lips doe honour me, but have removed their hearts farre from me; and their feare towards me is taught by the precepts of men, therefore behold I will proceed to doe a mervailous worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them: for the wiſedome of their wiſe men ſhall periſh, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider, thirdly, what woes, and woes, and woes, our Saviour thunders out againſt the Scribes and Phariſees for hypocriſie, <hi>Woe be unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 25.25.27.29.</note>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:155203:17"/> and again, and again, <hi>Woe be unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites:</hi> Beloved, if we be hypocrites as they were, <hi>Tithe mint and Cumin, and neglect the weighty matters of the Law, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and juſtice, and mercy,</hi> as they did: <hi>Make long prayers, and under a pretence devoure Widowes houſes,</hi> as they did: <hi>Waſh the outſide of the diſh and platter, while within we are full of ravening and wickedneſſe,</hi> write Gods Commandements very large and faire upon our <hi>Phylacteries,</hi> but ſhut them quite out of our hearts: <hi>Build the Sepulchres of the old Prophets, and kill their ſucceſſors,</hi> in fine, if we be like <hi>painted Sepulchres</hi> as they were, <hi>outwardly garniſhed and beautifull, but within full of dead mens bones and rottenneſſe,</hi> we are then to make accompt that all theſe woes belong to us and will one day over-take us.</p>
            <p>Conſider, laſtly, the terrible example of <hi>Ana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira,</hi> and how they were ſnatcht away in the very act of their ſinne, and that their fault was (as the Text tell us) that they lyed unto God. Beloved, we have done ſo a thouſand thouſand times: our whole lives (if ſincerely examined) would appeare, I feare, litttle leſſe but a perpetuall lye; hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto God hath beene mercifull to us, and given us time to repent, but let us not proceed ſtill in imitating their facts, leſt at length we be made partakers of their fall.</p>
            <p>God of his infinite mercy prevent this in every one of us, even for his Sonne our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt's ſake; by whom and with whom, in the unity of the holy Spirit, be all honour and glory to the eternall Father, world without end: <hi>Amen.</hi>
